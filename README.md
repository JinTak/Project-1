# Project-1

### Space Racer 2: Into the Void

For my first project, I would like to make a game similar to [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). 
I would very much like to make an extension of my Week-2-Assesment assignment, which is called Space Racer. I would like to keep the same game pieces while changing the functionality of the game. This project will be a shooter type game. You will be able to have two players, who will compete to destroy more asteroids. 

**Basic Functionality**
- Asteroids will populate at the top of the page
- Player will be able to shoot projectile at the enemies
- Asteroids will disappear as they are hit
- User will gain 1 Bitcoin for every asteroid destroyed
- Game is over when all asteroids are extinguished

**Stretch Goals**
- Asteroids will shoot projectiles 
- Asteroids will fly down and attempt to hit the players
- User will be able to choose game background
- User will be able to choose game character
