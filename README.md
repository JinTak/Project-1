### Space Racer 2: Into the Void

For my first project, I would like to make a clone of [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga). 
I would very much like to make an extension of my Week-2-Assesment assignment, which is called Space Racer. I would like to keep the same game pieces while changing the functionality of the game. This project will be a shooter type game. You will be able to have two players, who will compete to kill more enemies. 

**Basic Functionality**
- Enemies will populate at the top of the page
- Player will be able to shoot projectile at the enemies
- Enemies will disappear as they are hit
- User will gain 100 points for every enemy kill
- Game is over when all enemies are extinguished

**Stretch Goals**
- Enemies will shoot projectiles 
- Enemies will fly down and attempt to hit the players
- User will be able to choose game background
- User will be able to choose game character
